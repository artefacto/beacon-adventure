## Welcome to the Beacon Adventure page

This is checkpoint 1 for the Eddystone beacons. 

This is some demo content to show you how you can access (and provide) contextual web content using the Physical Web. 

### Eddystone

Eddystone is an open Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard developed by Google for BLE beacon broadcast. Itâ€™s open and multiplatform, so you can use it with both Android and iOS. 

It's also different from the iBeacon standard (developed by Apple) in that it can be accessed using compatible browsers (like Chrome and Opera) and mobile features (like Google Nearby) and doesn't require a dedicated app. 

There are a lot of different beacons, some of which support both the iBeacon and Eddystone beacon protocol. Which is pretty neat.
